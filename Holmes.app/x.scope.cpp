// HOLMES


// problem
// an entire generator of hopeless home buyers


// solution
// Holmes (Holmes doesn't sell homes, Holmes sells hope)


// what is Holmes?
// dynamic real estate calculator 


// what does Holmes do?
// takes client ASSESTS and ASPIRATIONS, weighs them against market POSTURE and PATTERNS to produce client OPTIONS with ARGUMENTS
// (this is what a client wants, this is what a client has, this is how the market works, this is WHAT THE CLIENT NEEDS TO DO to can get what the client wants)


// how does Holmes do this?
// 
// first time home buyer -
// 
// takes clients dream home price and generates minimum assets to buy that home
// --- returns ---
//	1. the gap (if any) between client assets and client aspirations
//  2. how to close the gap
//  3. why client should want to close the gap and buy that dream home
//
// clients with home(s) - 
//	1. give client the bigger picture
//	2. offer options (renting options / upgrade home options / home equity options)


// how is Holmes different?
// Holmes offers SOLUTIONS (HOW TO MAKE IT HAPPEN) and the BIGGER PICTURE (WHY MAKE IT HAPPEN)



// NOW WHAT...

// code works... has all info we need...
// 1. print helpful information (keep it simple)
// 2. Help user chose a plan...? (if they chose to save for down payment... need to create calculate to make sure they save faster then inflation
// watch interest rates for drops... show homes at lower listings prices they can currently afford... how to make more money options...










// to do :
//		1.a.a. what information do I actually need?
// 
//		1.a. create a class called Client that builds / allows access to all calculated information (passing it function to function to function is sloppy bro hard to follow)
//			// START BY MOVING/SETTING ALL VARIABLES IN function firstTime();
//		1. verify all calculations are correct
//		2. verify variable naming makes since
//		3. finish print all information possible in bigger picture (what else do we need there)
//		4. super simplify what we want the user to see at that time. and document all we have access too there
//		5. after all that is done. IT'S TIME TO BRIDGE THE GAP!


//		Write a program for current home owners (first time home buyers will be able to use some of these features as well, like "when can I rent my house
//			at cost function"
